DocIt
*****

DocIt is a quick and easy command line utility for auto-generating 
documentation of a command line based work flow from a user's .bash_history 
file generated during said work flow. This allows for a procedure executed 
in the command line to be quickly documented as it is developed and ironed
out. Doing so means producing documentation of a new procedure does not 
interfere with the actual development and experimentation of that procedure.

DocIt can generate documentation in either the Markdown (GitHub Flavored),
or reStructuredText formats.
