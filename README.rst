DocIt
*****

DocIt is a quick and easy command line utility for auto-generating 
documentation of a command line based workflow from a user's .bash_history 
file generated during said workflow. This allows for a procedure executed 
in the command line to be quickly documented as it is developed and ironned
out. Doingso means producing documentation of a new procedure does not 
interfer with the actual development and expirimentation of that procedure.

DocIt can generate documentation in either the Markdown (GitHub Flavored),
or reStructuredText formats.
